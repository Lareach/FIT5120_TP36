            "<p>Installing a solar electricity system in Victoria offers several financial benefits, including rebates for solar photovoltaic (PV) systems, hot water systems, solar batteries, and interest-free loans. Proper planning and installation, guided by resources like the ‘Buyers Guide developed with Renew’, are crucial for maximising energy and cost savings. Considerations include system size, component quality, and choosing a reputable installer. Rebates enhance affordability, and understanding grid connection is important for effective system integration. Warranties and consumer protections provide additional security and confidence in the investment. <a href='https://www.solar.vic.gov.au/solar-panel-rebate' target='_blank'>Learn more>></a></p>"

            "<ul>" +
            "<li>Install Solar Panels: The initial installation cost is high, but it's a cost-effective method to charge an electric car. Solar panels generate free, clean energy, reducing overall home energy expenses.</li>" +
            "<li>Charge During Off-Peak Periods: Charging costs are lower during off-peak hours, typically at night. Chargers can be programmed to avoid peak hours, enhancing savings.</li>" +
            "<li>Avoid Rapid Charging: Although rapid charging is convenient, it can be very expensive.</li>" +
            "<li>Utilise Government Schemes: Incentives are available to reduce the costs of electric vehicle adoption. Grants cover up to 75% of the cost of installing a home charging wall box.</li>" +

            "<p><strong>About:</strong></p>" +
            "<p>Double-glazed windows are highly energy efficient because they significantly reduce heat transfer between the interior of a building and the external environment. This is achieved by trapping air or inert gas between two panes of glass, creating an insulating barrier. This barrier helps to keep warm air inside during colder months and prevents hot air from entering during warmer months. As a result, these windows can reduce heat loss or gain by about 30% compared to single-glazed windows, leading to more stable indoor temperatures and lower energy costs for heating and cooling. This efficiency makes double-glazing a popular choice for enhancing a building's energy performance.</p>"

            "<li>Optimize Light Fittings: Avoid using downlights when possible as they require more units and increase energy consumption and costs. Instead, plan your lighting with energy-efficient fixtures to reduce overall energy use.</li>" +
            "<li>Manage Usage: Always turn off lights when they are not in use to reduce energy costs. Also, make use of natural light as much as possible, which can significantly decrease the need for artificial lighting.</li>" +

            "<li>Seal Draughts: Address these draughts by sealing gaps around doors, windows, exhaust fans, fireplaces, and other areas where air leakage occurs. This includes sealing evaporative cooling outlets and blocking chimney draughts.</li>" +
            "<li>Use the Right Materials: Choose appropriate draught-proofing materials based on the location and type of draughts. The specific approach will vary, so selecting the correct products is essential.</li>" +
            "<li>Consider Safety with Gas Appliances: If you have internal gas appliances, ensure that draught proofing does not block required ventilation for these devices. It's crucial to have a licensed gas fitter check and service gas appliances, especially after sealing draughts, to ensure they operate safely.</li>" +
            "<li>Leverage Government Incentives: Take advantage of programs like the Victorian Energy Saver Incentive Scheme, which supports draught-proofing efforts financially.</li>" +
