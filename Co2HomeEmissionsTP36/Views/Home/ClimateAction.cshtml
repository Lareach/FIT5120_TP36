			<!-- Text explaining climate change -->
			<div class="website-text" style="padding-top:3%">
				<p>
					Climate change refers to long-term shifts in temperatures and weather patterns.
					Such shifts can be natural, due to changes in the sun’s activity or large volcanic eruptions.
					But since the 1800s,
					<a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/2021/08/09/ar6-wg1-20210809-pr/">human activities have been the main driver of climate change</a>
					, primarily due to the burning of fossil fuels like coal, oil and gas.
					Burning fossil fuels generates greenhouse gas emissions that act like a blanket wrapped around the Earth,
					trapping the sun’s heat and raising temperatures.

				<!-- Fossil Fuel Explanation -->
				<h4>Fossil fuels</h4>
				<p>
					Fossil fuels are burnable material made from the decomposition of 
					carbon-based life such as plants and animals. From these fossil fuels 
					we derive coal, gasoline, and natural gas all of which we burn and 
					convert to energy. These are known as non-renewable energy as we 
					are consuming them far quicker than we can make them. These non-renewables 
					produce carbon dioxide and other ‘greenhouse gases’ when burnt. 
					These greenhouse gasses act as a blanket over the earth that trap 
					in heat and keep our planet warm. While they are essential for life 
					on the planet, we have been producing far more greenhouse gases than 
					would be naturally occurring and thus have been warming the planet 
					quicker than life can adapt.

					<!-- Global Warming Explanation -->
					<h4>Effects of global warming</h4>
					<p>
						The effect of this warming differs from place to place but generally
						we can see the climate changing through melting glaciers, sea level rises,
						longer more intense droughts and oceanic warming which
						may threaten biodiversity in the sea.

					<h4>Local Information</h4>
					<p>
						How has climate change affected life in Victoria?
						As you can see in the graph below, the Co2 levels in the world have increased
						so has the average temperature here in Melbourne! Additionally,
						we have had historically long and frequent droughts.
