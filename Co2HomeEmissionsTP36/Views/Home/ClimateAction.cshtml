                    Climate change refers to long-term shifts in temperatures and weather patterns.
                    Such shifts can be natural, due to changes in the sun’s activity or large volcanic eruptions.
                    But since the 1800s,
                    <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/2021/08/09/ar6-wg1-20210809-pr/" target="_blank">human activities have been the main driver of climate change</a>
                    , primarily due to the burning of fossil fuels like coal, oil and gas.
                    Burning fossil fuels generates greenhouse gas emissions that act like a blanket wrapped around the Earth,
                    trapping the sun’s heat and raising temperatures.

        and how it correlates with atmospheric Co2 levels. Remember this graph when 
        you are questioning why we are trying so hard to reduce Co2 emissions!

                <!-- Fossil Fuel Explanation -->
                <h4>Fossil fuels</h4>
                <p>
                    Fossil fuels are burnable material made from the decomposition of 
                    carbon-based life such as plants and animals. From these fossil fuels 
                    we derive coal, gasoline, and natural gas all of which we burn and 
                    convert to energy. These are known as non-renewable energy as we 
                    are consuming them far quicker than we can make them. These non-renewables 
                    produce carbon dioxide and other ‘greenhouse gases’ when burnt. 
                    These greenhouse gasses act as a blanket over the earth that trap 
                    in heat and keep our planet warm. While they are essential for life 
                    on the planet, we have been producing far more greenhouse gases than 
                    would be naturally occurring and thus have been warming the planet 
                    quicker than life can adapt.

                <h4>Effects of global warming</h4>
                <p>
                    The effect of this warming differs from place to place but generally
                    we can see the climate changing through melting glaciers, sea level rises,
                    longer more intense droughts and oceanic warming which
                    may threaten biodiversity in the sea.

                    How has climate change affected life in Victoria? 
                    As you can see in the graph, the increasing atmospheric 
                    Co2 levels have driven up the average temperature here in 
                    Melbourne! Additionally, we have had historically long 
                    and frequent droughts. Indeed, from 1970 – 1998 we had 
                    only two years of drought on record. From 1998 – 2024 
                    we have had 13 years that have been considered drought 
                    conditions. This and other extreme weather events are 
                    likely to become more common as the climate continues 
                    to change.
