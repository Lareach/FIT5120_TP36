                                <p>Heat-pump water heaters extract heat from the surrounding air to heat water, using about 60-75% less electricity than conventional electric heaters. They function like reverse-cycle air conditioners, using electricity for the heat pump, not for directly heating water. Available as integrated units or split systems. They require proper ventilation and consideration for noise, especially near bedrooms. Suitable for off-peak electricity tariffs, these systems can also utilise timers to align with solar photovoltaic systems for efficient energy use. Eligible for government rebates in some regions, they are efficient in warmer climates but may have slower reheat rates in cold weather.</p>

                                    <strong>Money-Saving Tips:</strong><br>
                                    <em><strong>Ovens</strong></em>
                                    <ul>

Use smaller appliances like electric fry pans, pressure cookers, or microwaves for smaller meals to save energy.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                    <em><strong>Stovetops</strong></em>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Choose an Energy-Efficient Stovetop: Induction cooktops are preferred for their efficiency as they heat the cookware directly without heating the cooking surface.</li>
                                        <li>Use Your Stovetop Efficiently: Use flat-bottomed pans for better heat transfer. Match pots with the hotplate size to minimize energy loss. Simmer instead of boiling vigorously to save energy.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                    <em><strong>Microwaves</strong></em>
                                    <ul>
